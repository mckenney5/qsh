## Description
This is the rewrite of quick terminal, quick terminal server edition, and QTerminal. 
Quick shell aims at replacing bash or zsh with a smaller and lighter program and follows
the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/). (note this project is not
associated with suckless).

## Compiling and Testing
This program allows a couple of compiling options.

The simplest way is to compile by `make`

##### Make Options:
* `make GNU`	: makes the user interface use [GNU readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)
* `make TINY`	: makes the UI only use fgets (aka no line editing, like sh(1))
* `make DEBUG`	: adds debugging symbols to the program, along with verbose output
* `make`	: makes the UI use the [linenoise libray](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise)

##### (optional) Colors:
* NO_COLOR (`-DNO_COLOR`)	: disables color in the prompt **ONLY**
